# Markov Chains Policy Improvement Algorithm

This is an implementation of the policy improvement algorithm which I have seen in my course, Stochastic Models in Operations Research. The algorithm minimizes the expected cost in Markov Chain Decision Processes.

The code requires valid costs, available decisions(which actions are available at which states) and transition probabilities matrices. The way they are given as inputs are explained in the beginning of the code.

My implementation of the policy improvement algorithm.
